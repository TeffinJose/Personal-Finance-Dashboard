The Personal Finance Dashboard project aims to empower users to take control of their financial lives through effective tracking and planning tools. By delivering a user-friendly interface and robust features, the dashboard will help users make informed financial decisions, ultimately leading to better financial outcomes.

The Problem: Managing personal finances can feel like a juggling act—expenses fly away, budgets get lost, and financial goals fade into the background. Many people struggle to keep track of their money, leading to confusion and missed opportunities.
